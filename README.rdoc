= Klastfm

First of all: This is not an Amarok script in the common sense. Do not install this in Amarok! Read this file to get the idea!

This tool grabs your statistic from last.fm and merges it into your existing amarok database.

Since last.fm relies on MusicBrainz ( http://musicbrainz.org ) for tagging, in general it is a good idea to tag your media with MusicBrainz Picard ( http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard ) By tagging your music with Picard (or any other ID3 tagger using MusicBrainz) you will get the best results when using this script. All tracks not recognized by this script are skipped.

It will synchronize your playcount (how often you listened to a specific track), the first and last played date of a track (with the accuracy of a few days) and it will also score your tracks by some voodoo algorithm.

The idea is derived from "Last Sync" ( http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Last+Sync?content=65784 ). I think the idea is pretty cool, but "Last Sync" is too old to work with newer versions of amarok. The last version is from 2007 and the main problems are that it handles sqlite databases only (Amarok 1.x) and it uses the legacy last.fm api.

Bring some time! Since you will synchronize a lot with last.fm api this script will run a long time. For my account (ca. 32000 tracks) it needs nearly 2 hours!
